# Black-Jack-Game
Black-Jack-Game is a popular casino banking game in which player needs to draw cards and its total should be 21 .
If player gets 21 he/she will win game and if less than 21 they will get another chance or morethan 21 you are out of game .
In this I have use HTML , CSS to make layout of the game .
As you can see on the picture.

In this I use Javascript to build internal system of the game that how game will perform when we click buttons in the page .
In this I create three function 
1. startGame() - this function is use to start the game and reset the game.
   startGame() internally call another function i.e. rendergame() which generate cardds number in the game .
2.getRandomCard() - This function is use to generate new card number .
